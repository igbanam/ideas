# Formaldehyde

Programmers have compilers which assist them through writing out programs. These compilers check types, flow, — and these days — memory safety. Poets, on the other hand, have the muse for inspiration, and a human editor for correction. Aside from the inspiration, most devices the poet uses is codified somewhere. On that codification, Formaldehyde is an automated editor and assistant in writing poetry.
