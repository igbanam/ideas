# Ideas

I've maintained a list of ideas on Notion to eventuallyâ„¢ get to. My workflow does not include Notion on a day to day, so I am ~bringing this to GitHub~ open-sourcing my idea list. If you feel like resonate with you, and you have the capacity to develop them, please go ahead and begin. If you need me to be part of it, I could contribute as time becomes available.

## How to Contribute

There are different paths to contribute.

### Solo

You're a superstar developer who has enough time to devote to the project. The idea resonates with you so much you want to run with it.

- Create a repository.
- Get developing :rocket:

### Lead

You're interested in seeing the idea come to life. You have some time on your hands but not enough. You can kickstart the project, but you may not be as involved day-to-day. 

- Create a discussion on this repository to shape the project.
- Build a team of enthusiasts from the discussions.
- Create a repository to collaborate in.

### Mind

You have ideas about the idea. You think it's awesome, but you believe it can be awesomer!

- (Optionally) Create a discussion for your thoughts.
- Edit the specific idea; add your awesomeness.
- Send a pull-request here.
